      * Time for Milk and Cookies? - Create a function which accepts a Date and returns true if the date is Christmas Eve (December 24th) otherwise false.	Bruce
      * Use faker to generate a child, their address and if they are on santas naughty list or nice list.	Dougmac
      * Free Coffee-cup counter - Every 6 cups of coffee I buy, I get the 7th cup for free. Create a function that takes the total cups I have bought and returns how many free cups I would recieve.	Bruce
      * Make a simple UI and hook it into whatever API necessary to show a random location where it's snowing at any given time	Craig
      * Seasonal Coffee. Give a date, return syrup for the season (eg pumpkin spice for october).	Dougmac
      * Holiday counter. Set your leave dates. Program runs and gives you days of holiday left.	Dougmac
      * Generate an random string which is then parsed to check if it contains "merry christmas". If not, increase the length of the string until it does. 	Dougmac
      * Code a button that plays a christmas sound when pressed.	Dougmac
      * UNIX countdown. Code the remaining unix seconds between now and christmas. Bonus for real time countdown.	Dougmac
      * Broken Bridge - Create a function which accepts a string of characters to represent a bridge which will return true if the bridge is safe to walk accross (does not contain any empty spaces), otherwise false.	Bruce
      * No Conditionals? - Create a function that accepts either 1 or 0 which returns 1 if given 0 and 0 if given 1. The function cannot contain conditional statements.	Bruce
      * Write any small program that you like, but every function name and variable should be unintuitively given a festive name.	Dougmac
      * Implement a simple compression algorithm to convert a given string. (e.g. AAAABBBB -> A4B4) The smaller the output the better! 	Matt Munro
      * Make a 30 minute winter themed game - you may use an existing game and amend it, or you may attempt to code from scratch	Craig
      * H4ck3r Sp34k - Create a function which accepts a string and returns a coded hacker speak version with "a" replaced with 4, "e" replaced 3, "i"replaced with 1, "o" replaced with 0 and "s" replaced with 5.	Bruce
      * Do something fun with an image (apply a filter, splice together two images, flip etc)	Matt Munro
      * Write a program using your voice instead of typing (e.g. windows dictation toolbar)	Matt Munro
      * Christmas cracker joke generator	Because he "ho ho hos"
      * Write a function to print an ascii christmas tree of a provided height	Stephen
      * Generate a string and then sort its contents into two arrays, one of numbers and one of letters. Bonus for sorting the arrays.	Dougmac
      * Write a small piece of code with a deliberate mistake. Others must race to find it after being given it at the same time. Bonus for those who don't use debugging tools.	Dougmac
      * Provide your DOB. Return if you are allowed to play with LEGO.	Dougmac
